# Rational

In the past I have created multiple slide decks of the same topic(IoT), it is a nightmare everytime to keep track on which version is more recently, what are the changes, where did I store it.

- from powerpoint to reveal.js/slides.com
- runs in browser
- text based
- diagram in plantuml
- variation branches 
- variation in level of depth
