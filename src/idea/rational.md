## it is based on the following ideas:
* No difference between Tools for developers and tools by developers
* MDE can do more 
* System for developers are much more scalable and stable (gitlab)
* Approach the system as a whole instead of various artifacts
* view everything as data, much like physical notebooks, nothing is erased
