# Rational

during my last project logging correct data as correct time with in correct level, when to log, how to log, when to keep data,when to publish forms a big chuck of spend time to think about



- yml, json, eden, !xml, sql, nosql, binary datastructure

- thunk differently

- history of data is kept in git, data is human readable,json form?

- can be validated/checked published etc
